This project is a React + TypeScript Vite web app for keeping track of scores in the Turkish game Okey. The app should allow users to:

- Add players
- Record scores for each round
- Display a scoreboard
- Reset the game
- Use a modern, clean UI (Material-UI or similar)
- Store all data in memory (no backend required)
